AFB1 production was optimum at 25-30 °C and 0.99 aw. These results are similar to some previous reports on optimal conditions for A. flavus ranging between 25 and 30 °C and 0.95–0.99 aw (Abdel-Hadi et al., 2010, Astoreca et al., 2014, Giorni et al., 2011, Giorni et al., 2007, Mousa et al., 2011, Peromingo et al., 2016).
